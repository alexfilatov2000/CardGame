## â˜‘ TODO

- [X] custom design
- [X] User authorization. Primarily about registration, so I'll use "@hapi/joi" module for validation email and password, and "argon2" module to hash password, if everything correct I'll sent all data to database. Now about logIn, here we will use the same validation as in registration and verify password hash with "argon2"
- [x] Drop and down.
- [ ] Fight battle
